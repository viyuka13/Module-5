# Arithmetic Operations Using Multiple Inheritance in Python

This Python program demonstrates **multiple inheritance** by performing basic arithmetic operations â€” Addition, Subtraction, and Division â€” using three classes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program to calculate **Add, Sub & Division** using **Multiple Inheritance**.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. **Define `Calculation1` class**
   - Contains `Summation(a, b)` method to return the sum of two numbers.
2. **Define `Calculation2` class**
   - Contains `Subtraction(a, b)` method to return the difference of two numbers.
3. **Define `Derived` class**
   - Inherits from both `Calculation1` and `Calculation2`.
   - Contains `Division(a, b)` method to return the division result.
4. **Input**
   - Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
5. **Process**
   - Create an object of the `Derived` class.
   - Call `Summation`, `Subtraction`, and `Division` methods.
6. **Output**
   - Display the results of the three operations.

## ðŸ’» Program 
      class Calculation1:
          def Summation(self, a, b):
              return a + b
      
      class Calculation2:
          def Subtraction(self, a, b):
              return a - b
      
      class Derived(Calculation1, Calculation2):
          def Division(self, a, b):
              if b != 0:
                  return a / b
              else:
                  return "Division by zero error"
      
      num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
      num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
      
      obj = Derived()
      
      print("Sum:", obj.Summation(num1, num2))
      print("Subtraction:", obj.Subtraction(num1, num2))
      print("Division:", obj.Division(num1, num2))

##Result
The program correctly performs addition, subtraction, and division using multiple inheritance and displays the results based on user input.
